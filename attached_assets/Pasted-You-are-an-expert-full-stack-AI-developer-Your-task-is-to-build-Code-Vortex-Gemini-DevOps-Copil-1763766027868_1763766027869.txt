You are an expert full-stack AI developer. Your task is to build **Code Vortex – Gemini DevOps Copilot**, a **revolutionary, hackathon-winning, full-stack developer tool** with the following specifications:

1️⃣ **Core Concept**
- AI Copilot using **Gemini API or GPT (latest model)** for all code generation, explanation, testing, documentation, and refactoring.
- Real-time **GitHub Insights Dashboard** showing commits, PRs, issues, contributors, and hotspot file analysis.
- Explainable AI: user can paste any code → returns line-by-line explanation, performance notes, security issues, suggested tests.
- Serverless architecture using **Netlify Functions**, no traditional backend needed.
- Fully deployable on **GitHub + Netlify**, production-ready.

2️⃣ **Tech Stack**
- Next.js 14+ (TypeScript, App Router)
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- lucide-react icons
- Recharts for charts
- Netlify Functions for backend logic
- LocalStorage for user settings (PAT, theme, model)

3️⃣ **UI/UX & Visuals**
- Dark mode default
- Glassmorphism with smooth gradients
- Landing page with **3D floating cubes**, particle effects, moving objects
- Smooth scroll animations, hover transitions, loading skeletons
- Interactive dashboard, animated counters, live status pulses
- Professional typography and spacing
- Polished, hackathon-level aesthetic

4️⃣ **Integrations**
- GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, VS Code, Replit, Slack, Jira, Linear
- Fetch GitHub repos, commits, PRs, issues, raw file content
- AI hotspot detection: risk scoring for frequently changed files

5️⃣ **AI Copilot Features**
- Chat interface with streaming responses
- Modes: generate code, tests, docs, boilerplate snippets, refactor suggestions
- Gemini/GPT models toggle: standard vs pro/flash
- Smart insights: analyze repos → key issues, potential bugs, suggested tests, performance improvements

6️⃣ **Serverless Functions**
- `/netlify/functions/gemini.ts`: accepts prompt, mode, codeContext → returns streaming AI response
- `/netlify/functions/githubRepos.ts`, `/githubActivity.ts`, `/githubFile.ts`: fetch GitHub data with proper CORS, error handling, TypeScript types

7️⃣ **Dashboard Requirements**
- Summary Cards: commits (7 days), PRs (open/merged/closed), open issues, hotspot files
- Charts: commit activity, PR status, contributor activity
- Hotspot Table: file path, commit frequency, last modified, risk score, clickable AI analysis modal

8️⃣ **Settings Page**
- GitHub PAT input, repo selector
- AI model selector (Flash / Pro)
- Theme toggle (dark/light)
- Store values in **localStorage**

9️⃣ **Folder Structure**
